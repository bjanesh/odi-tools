Welcome to the documentation for odi-tools
==========================================
**odi-tools** is a suite of tools written in Pyraf, Astropy,
Scipy, and Numpy to process individual QuickReduced images
into single stacked images using a set of "best practices" for ODI data.

In this documentation we will provide descriptions of how to obtain and run
the software, as well as a brief tutorial on using QuickReduced images.
